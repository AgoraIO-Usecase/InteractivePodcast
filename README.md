A typical **Livecast** has an anchor and several audiences.

in which:
- The anchor talks and the audience hear the host.
- The anchor invites the audience for interaction and the audience switches the user role to be a co-host.
- The anchor can mute or unmute the co-host, and delete or add a host position.
- Any change to the host state and host position is immediately known to the host, co-host, and audience in the channel.

This use case particularly applies to scenarios such as  online KTV and FM radio.

Agora supports real-time voice interaction between a maximum of one host + 16 co-hosts.
